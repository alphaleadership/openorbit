Build instructions
==================

This document details how to build Open Orbit from sources. In order to build Open Orbit,
there is first a few dependencies that must be satisfied.

Dependencies
************

Required tools and libraries are the following, Open Orbit is impossible to build without 
these (and you need the developer packages for these):
	* Pyrex: Python / C bridge and wrappers
	* Python: Scripting langage (embedded in Open Orbit)
	* CMake: Cross platform configuration of software builds
	* libSDL: Library for creating windows and handling I/O
	* libODE: Physics / Dynamics simulation library

The following tools and libraries are optional, they add additional functionality only:
	* libcheck: Required if regression tests are to be built. It is recommended that
		you build these if you have checked out Open Orbit from the SCM. 


Configuration
*************

UNIX like systems
-----------------

Create a separate build directory, enter the directory and run cmake on the top
level CMakeLists.txt file.

Type make, and then make install

There is also a convenience script called configure that let you do the normal
./configure dance (except for the fact that it will not run in the src directory).
