HACKING OPEN ORBIT

0. ABSTRACT
This document describes the architecture and the coding conventions used in
Open Orbit. Submitted patches must confirm to the coding conventions in order
to be accepted. Note that these conventions are not yet finished, and under
development. This means that some code might not be consequent with these guide
lines, if you find such an item, please notify the authors and the code will
hopefully be re-factored.

1. ARCHITECTURE

A brief architectural description of open orbit should be here.

2. CODE STYLE
Open Orbit is written in C and tries to confirm to the C99 standard.
GNU-extensions are only allowed when they are not strictly needed for the code
to work.

The naming of symbols is not done with CamelCase, but with underscores. All
macros should be in ALL_CAPS. Global variables shall have a prefix in caps
identifying the module where the variable is defined and then named as a normal
variable, e.g. FOO_bar. 

2.1 Lines
The line length may not be more than 80 characters for code and documentation.

2.2 Functions
Functions are declared in the headers on one line if possible. When they appear
in the C-files, the return type is written on a separate line and the open
brace as well. The pointer splat is considered part of the return type. Note
that normal pointers have the splat adjacent to the variable name.

int*
foobar(int foo, int bar)
{
    int *pointer;
    ...
}


Calling a function will be done without white space between the name and the
parantheses. Any gnu-style coding will be punished by cutting of the fingers.

RIGHT: foobar(1, 1);
WRONG: foobar (1, 1);

2.3 Control Structures
Control structures such as while, if and for shall have a space between the
keyword and the first parentheses. The first curly brace shall be on the same
line.

while ( FOO ) {

}
