This file is supposed to list the public API functions and headers.

The public API exists in order to let 3rd parties write additional
spacecraft simulation modules (adding spacecrafts and components of
such systems to the simulator).

At present (2012-04-20), the public API is not ready or even close
to being finished, the files forming the API are listed below:

Public API headers (TODO):
       include/openorbit/log.h: Logging functions.
