Open Orbit
==========
*An open source interactive spacecraft simulator.*


Open Orbit is a free realistic and modular spacecraft simulator. The purpose is
to let the user experience orbital space flight in a realistic manner.

The package that this read me is part of is the source distribution, this
read me will give you pointers to where you find manuals, build instructions,
documentation and so forth. This document should be used as an entry point for
you, in order to help you get familiar with the open orbit source code, build
procedures, plugin development and so forth.

Note that this software is distributed in accordance to the MPL licence.
However it is possible to redistribute the software as GPL or LGPL licensed
code.

For build instructions see INSTALL.txt
For coding conventions see HACKING.txt
For the license see COPYING.txt
For plugin development see PLUGINS.txt (not yet written)

Some of the information mentioned is also maintained in the project wiki. At
the moment it is not easy to tell which info is the newest one, but a more
formal procedure for wiki and .txt updating will hopefully be in place some
day.
